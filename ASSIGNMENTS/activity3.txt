write an algorithm to find average of two numbers 

algorithm using natural language :
       1. Start
       2. initialize sum = 0 and avg = 0
       3. Read first number from user add it to sum
       4. Read second number from user add it to sum
       5. compute avg=sum/2
       4. print avg
       5. stop


using pseudocode:
 sum=0,avg=0;
 a=3, b=5;
 sum = a+b;
 return sum
 avg = sum/2;
 return avg
