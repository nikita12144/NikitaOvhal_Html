<p>Software Testing is a method to check whether the actual software product 
matches expected requirements and to ensure that software product is Defect free.</p>
<h3>RGBA</h3>
<p1>Manual Testing is a type of software testing in which test cases are executed
 manually by a tester without using any automated tools. The purpose of Manual Testing 
is to identify the bugs, issues, and defects in the software application. 
Manual software testing is the most primitive technique of all testing types and it helps to find critical
 bugs in the software application</p1>
<h3>HSL</h3>
<p2>Automation Testing is a software testing technique that performs using special automated testing
 software tools to execute a test case suite. 
On the contrary, Manual Testing is performed by a human sitting in front of a computer carefully executing the test steps.
 The automation testing software can also enter test data into the System Under Test, compare expected and actual results and generate detailed test reports.
